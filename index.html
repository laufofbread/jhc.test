            <h2>Film Genres</h2>
        
            <p>
                Film genres may appear to be readily categorizable from the setting of the film. Nevertheless, films with the same settings can be very different, due to the use of different themes or moods. For example, while both The Battle of Midway and All Quiet on the Western Front are set in a wartime context and might be classified as belonging to the War Film genre, the first examines the themes of honor, sacrifice and valour, and the second is an anti-war film which emphasizes the pain and horror of war.

                While some genres are based on story content (the war film), others are borrowed from literature (comedy, melodrama) or from other media (the musical). Setting can not be used as a simple definition of genre: while there is an argument that film noir movies could be deemed to be set in an urban setting, in cheap hotels and underworld bars, many classic noirs take place mainly in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road.

            <h3>Definition of Film Genre</h3>
            <p>
                Genre is often a vague term with no fixed boundaries, and many films cross into multiple genres. Recently, film theorist Robert Stam challenged whether genres really exist, or whether they are merely made up by critics. Stam has questioned whether "genres [are] really 'out there' in the world or [whether they are] really the construction of analysts". Furthermore, he has asked whether there is a "... finite taxonomy of genres or [whether they are] in principle infinite". He asks whether film generes are "...timeless essences [or] ephemeral, time-bound entities? Are genres culture-bound or trans-cultural?" Stam has also asked whether genre analysis should aim at being descriptive or prescriptive.

                While genre is not a simple thing to define, at the same time, many moviegoers will feel they instinctively 'know' what makes a horror film or a romcom. Using the form below, enter a film genre, an example film and a <b>brief</b> description of why you feel the film falls in that genre.

                    I found this page really confusing! It needs more examples.

                    I love this topic. But I agree with the comment above that you should add more examples.
